# Crontab-Cron-Jobs

The software utility cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like computer operating systems. It typically automates system maintenance or administration of operating systems. Cron is most suitable for scheduling repetitive tasks. Scripts are also valuable for automatization of repetitive tasks, but they are used when you are present, while cron jobs can be executed while you are not there (not present physically).
